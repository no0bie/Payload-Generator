# How to use
> ./genMe [OS] [Payload type] [Port] [YesOrNo]

OS - Windows and Android (For Now)

Payload Type - http, https, tcp (they're all reverse meterpreter payloads)

Port - Pretty self explanatory, a port for the payload to listen on

YesOrNo - choose yes or no to execute a msfconsole automated script for your payload(can also be written with y for yes and n for no)
